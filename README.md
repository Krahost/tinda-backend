# tinda-backend

# this is the link to the frontend of the tindar -clone app:

https://github.com/Krahost/tinda

The backend was deployed on Heroku and it works well.

i will recommend you to use the same server services incase you want to use it for your own projects or improve upon it.
and i would recommend you to have knowledge in the Node.js, express and Mongodb to be able to make any changes on the backend files.

and know what you are doing before you make any changes otherwise you might mess up your work.

Thank you soo much. I love you all
